This is the fourth project realized in the course Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree in Udacity.

In this project, we'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We'll get to apply a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
